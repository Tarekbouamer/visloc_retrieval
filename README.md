## Image Retrieval Library

### TO DO?
* Add results on roxford5k rparis6k.

### Prerequisites
`
Main system requirements:
  * Python 3.6.9
  * Linux with GCC 7 or 8
  * PyTorch 1.13.0 Torchvision 0.14.0
  * CUDA 11.1
  * Faiss library (faiss-gpu 1.7.2)
`

### Setup

To install all other dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our code is split into two main components: a library containing implementations for the various network modules,
algorithms and utilities, and a set of scripts for training and testing the networks.

The library, called `cirtorch`, can be installed with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tarekbouamer/Image-Retrieval-for-Image-Based-Localization.git
cd Image-Retrieval-for-Image-Based-Localization
python setup.py install
```

## Training

Training involves three main steps: dataset preparation (automatic download), creating a configuration file and running the training
script.

The script downloads [The Retrieval-SfM-120k](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02512) trainning dataset and [The Revisiting Oxford and Paris](https://github.com/filipradenovic/revisitop) test sets and benchmarking to `$DataFolder`.

The configuration file is a simple text file in `ini` format. The default value of each configuration parameter, as well as a short description of what it does, is available in
[cirtorch/configuration/defaults/](cirtorch/configuration/defaults/).

To run the training:
```bash
sh scripts/train_globalF.sh 
```

It's also highly recommended to train on multiple GPUs in order to obtain good results.
Training logs, both in text and Tensorboard formats, will be written under `experiments`.


### Results
Table: Large-scale image retrieval results of our models on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets. 
We evaluate against the Easy, Medium and Hard with the mAP metric.
